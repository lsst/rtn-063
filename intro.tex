\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

In preparation for DRP (Data Release Processing), a processing of
some 17K exposures from the PDR2 HSC dataset were pushed through
a current version of the DRP pipelines.

These 17K exposures represents approximately 3\% of the first years' 
dataset in terms of number of exposures.

These exposures are then coadded into 710 tracts, including about 671
WIDE tracts of repeated depth a few in grizy bands, and 39 DEEP+UDEEP with
up to 426 overlapping exposures in some bands in some UDEEP tracts.

Each detector is a 2K x 4K pixel CCD image, of size about 57MB.
There are 103 science quality CCDs/exposure.  detector 9 is masked due
to quality and ccds 104-112 are not sky science chips.

For HSC, each tract covers about 2.6 sq degrees on the sky and is
sub-divided into 81 patches in a 9x9 grid.

The full LSSTCam has 4K x 4K pixel CCDs, there are 189 science CCDs.
Each tract on the sky is divided into 49=7x7 patches.

There are calibration exposures (flat fields, biases) pre-made.

all good visits obtained to date (minus 6 months) are processed 
through step1 (ISR, PSF characterization, source detection and 
measurement) step2a (gather source tables) and step2b (perform 
astrometric calibration) at multiple processing sites.

earlier pfrom earlier major pre-operations activity, which also served an an operations rehearsal and readiness check, we exercised the entire Data Management and System Performance extant toolchain starting from raw data at a Data Facility to serving it to science users and enabling science by a broad community of early adopter scientists. 

Between May 2023 Sep 2023 the HSC PDR2 was reprocessed with

In this document we discuss the management and process by which HSC PDR2 
reprocessing was performed:

\begin{itemize}
\item Campaign Management and communication is discussed in \secref{sec:management}
\item An overview of the processing is given in \secref{sec:processing}
\item Quality assurance and feedback to processing is discussed in  \secref{sec:qa}
\end{itemize}
